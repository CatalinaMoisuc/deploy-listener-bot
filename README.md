# deploy-listener-bot

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot)
> that listens to deployments and labels your issues with the environment name in which the PR linked to the issue was
> merged and deployed.
> 
> The `deploy-listener-bot` will work as intended only if you:
> * open PRs and mention the issue number in the PR description
> * when deploying your app, make use of the github deployment and deployment status API, marking the commit sha that
> is currently being deployed
> * every time you deploy keep two tags `${env}-old` and `${env}` up to date, replacing `env` with the environment in
> which you are deploying so that the bot can use the tags to figure out all the commits deployed since last time
> * for each deployment environment that you have (`${env}`), make sure you have a label with the same name in github
> * you can use the `CLOSING_ENV` environment variable to specify the last deployment environment in the chain so
> that when your code is deployed there, the issues will not only be labeled, but also closed 
>
> This bot is meant to be used with any Kanban board that matches issues with columns/stages based on labels, so you
> can use any boards like: Github Projects, Codetree etc. and your issues would move to the right column every time
> you are making a deployment.
